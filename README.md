# Advanced-Machine-Learnig-Master-ISI-

- ### Objectives :
--------------
The aim of this course (60h.) is to train students in advanced machine learning techniques such as
reinforcement learning and deep learning Starting from the basics of machine learning and neural
networks, the course introduces the key concepts of neural networks, from their theoretical definition to their
practical optimization, and presents classical architectures such as CNN, RNN, and GAN.

- ### Course syllabus :
-------------------
C1/TP1 (4h) – Introduction to machine learning.  
C2/TP2 (4h) – Tabular reinforcement learning.  
C3/TP3-TP4 (6h) – Fundamentals of neural networks (backpropagation and gradient descent), presentation of deep learning environments in Python (PyTorch,TensorFlow …).  
C4/TP5 (4h) – Introduction to deep learning (definition, applications, challenges), optimization and regularization (Adam, batch norm, dropout, data augmentation, …).  
C5/TP6 (4h) – Convolutional neural networks (CNN).  
C6/TP7 (4h) – Recurrent neural networks (RNN).  
C7/TP8 (4h) - Auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks.  
C8-C9/TP9 (4h) – Neural-network acceleration & compression.
