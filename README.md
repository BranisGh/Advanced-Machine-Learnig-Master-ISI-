# Advanced-Machine-Learnig-Master-ISI-


The aim of this course (60h.) is to train students in advanced machine learning techniques such as
reinforcement learning and deep learning Starting from the basics of machine learning and neural
networks, the course introduces the key concepts of neural networks, from their theoretical definition to their
practical optimization, and presents classical architectures such as CNN, RNN, and GAN.
